# INTRODUCTION
The aim of this project is to develop a simple inventory program for a
home appliance company.
The home appliance company has three major product types. These are
refrigerators, dishwashers, and washing machines. According to the user input
the program have the following capabilities:
• List all products in the inventory with their details.
• Add a new product.
• Change the number of available products in the inventory.
• Save the product data to a file named as “input.txt”.
# METHOD
The software which is named as GSIP (Gokay’s Simple Inventory Program)
could handle with all requirements of this project. There are 5 modes in this
program:
LISTER (List all products in the inventory with their details),
ADDER (Add a new product),
CHANGER (Change the number of available products in the inventory),
SAVER (Save the product data to file named as input.txt),
HANDBOOK (See the abbreviations used in this software).
When user runs the program, a welcome and mode selection screens appears:
After this user can select different modes for doing different processes
with entering their number. LISTER Mode has some abbreviations. User can
select HANDBOOK Mode for see definitions of these abbreviations. Program
works with user inputs. Choices for questions are expressed in parantheses.
After changes made with ADDER and CHANGER modes, user can save their lists
to input.txt file with selecting SAVER MODE.
I used some some C++ advantages like STL, composition and other object-
oriented principles. This project would be more difficult to solve with procedural
oriented programming languages for example C.
# CONCLUSION
That was an instructive project for me when applying my C++ theoretical
knowladge to the real World applications. This console-based application can be
improved by adding graphical user interface. The software can be used in
markets and shopping mall stores.
